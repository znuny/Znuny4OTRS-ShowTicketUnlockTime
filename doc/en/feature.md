# Functionality

By default,it is not possible to see the unlock time in the ticket zoom view. The unlock timeout is set in the queue settings and specifies when a locked ticket is automatically unlocked and be available for other agents again.

In the ticket zoom this package shows the unlock time in the ticket information box.

The unlock time is only shown if:

* the ticket is locked
* and the unlock timeout is configured for the queue
