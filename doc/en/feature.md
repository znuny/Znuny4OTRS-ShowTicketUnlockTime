By default,it is not possible to see the unlock time in the ticket zoom view. The unlock timeout is set in the queue settings and specifies when a locked ticket is automatically unlocked and it will be available for other agents.

In the ticket zoom this package shows you the unlock time in the ticket information box.

The unlock time is only shown if:

* Ticket is locked.
* A unlock timeout is configured for the queue.
